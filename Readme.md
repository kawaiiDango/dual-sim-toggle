## Dual Sim Toggle for AOSP based ROMs

Extremely minimalistic app with 3 buttons.
Can toggle individual SIM cards and optionally apply on boot, before the phone is unlocked.


You need to systemize this app with some app systemizer Magisk module.


This was created as most custom ROMs I have used do not have this feature.


May or may not work on your phones/ROMs.
